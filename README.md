# OrionCoin "ORC" ERC20 Token

This project demonstrates a ERC20 build created called "OrionCoin". This is a token in which was created to learn how to use Hardhat framework steps of compiling, testing and deployment on testenets / local network. While taking on this project, I started with a basic contract to compile the "Greeter" app. Then I deleted the files and created my test scripts and config files. When completed I was able to see the transaction on the testnet/Etherscan.

##  Learned in this project
- Installing HardHat framework for smart contract deployment and testing.
- Installed Waffle and Ethers plugins for Hardhat 
- Create ERC20 Smart Contract using Open Zeppelin Wizard.
- Create smart contract configuration to deployment on testnets Ropsten and Rinkeby.
- Connected hardhat local accounts for testing.
- npx hardhat compile and test [ complete ]
- npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js [ complete ]
- npx hardhat run --network ropsten [ complete ]
